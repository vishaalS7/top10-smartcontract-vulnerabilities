/**
 * Subtle access control bug:
 * - Developer set up roles in the implementation's constructor (or forgot to disable initializers),
 *   but when used via a proxy the constructor DOES NOT run.
 * - The initializer is left callable (or never called in deployment), so ANYONE can call initialize()
 *   and become DEFAULT_ADMIN_ROLE, then grant themselves critical roles and upgrade the implementation.
 *
 * This mixes upgradeability + access control and relies on incorrect deployment assumptions.
