# 1. Introduction

A **Denial of Service (DoS)** in Solidity happens when someone makes a smart contract stop working the way it’s supposed to.

In the **traditional internet world (Web2)**, a DoS attack means overloading a server with too many requests so it slows down or crashes—like blocking a phone line so no real calls can get through.

In **Ethereum and other blockchain systems (Web3)**, it works differently. Here, attackers target things like:
- **Gas** – the fuel needed to run transactions
- **Storage** – the space where contract data is saved
- **Computation** – the work the blockchain does to run the contract

By using certain tricks, attackers can make a contract **run out of resources** or **get stuck in a loop**, which stops other people from using it.

The problem is worse on blockchains because **smart contracts can’t be changed once deployed**. If a DoS bug is found, the only fix is usually to **deploy a new contract and move everything over**, which is slow, expensive, and risky.

That’s why DoS vulnerabilities are considered **serious security risks**—they can lock up money, freeze important functions, or even kill a project completely.
