# üîê Access Control in Solidity ‚Äì A Complete Guide

This repository is a companion resource for my blog **"Mastering Access Control in Solidity: The Ultimate Guide for Developers & Security Researchers"** published on Medium.  

It contains **no source code**, but serves as a placeholder for readers, researchers, and developers who want to explore the concepts discussed in the article.

## üìú About the Blog
In this guide, you‚Äôll learn:
- What access control is in Solidity and why it matters.
- Real-world case studies of major hacks caused by weak access control.
- Example vulnerabilities and Proof-of-Concepts (PoCs).
- Secure implementation patterns using OpenZeppelin.
- Best practices to keep your contracts safe.

## üõ°Ô∏è Purpose
Access control vulnerabilities are among the most **preventable yet most exploited** issues in Ethereum smart contracts.  
This blog aims to be a **one-stop resource** for both developers and security researchers.
